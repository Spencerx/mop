Beginnings</a></h1><p>This is the second in a series of articles, aimed at the professional
programmer. In my last article I introduced &quot;Model-Oriented
Programming&quot;, or MOP, and touched the subject of code generation.
</p><p>In this article we will construct a simple modeling language that
produces web sites. The goal is to generate the HTML for certain types
of web site very rapidly, from a simple high-level description. You will
learn how to write a simple code generator using the GSL scripting
language.
</p><p>You will need about one day to understand and start using these
techniques in your own projects.
</p><p>If you did not catch the first article in this series, you will want to
read it before starting this one.
</p><h1><a name="A2">2. Modeling a Web Site</a></h1><p>I'm going to propose a simple abstract model for a web site, as an
example. When you understand this example, you'll have a much better
idea of how we design new models, so that you can design your own.
</p><p>To start with, I'll explain how I design a new model, and then I'll take
you through the steps of building a code generator that brings it to
life.
</p><p>Our model lets us build simple web sites. A web site is a mixture of
different types of document, for instance:
</p><ul><li>
HTML pages for the content.</li><li>
JavaScript for menus.</li><li>
CSS style sheets for look and feel.</li><li>
Images for icons and for cosmetics.</li></ul><p>And so on. When we make a new model, it's worth asking the question,
&quot;how would I make a thousand of these?&quot; I.E., a thousand web sites.
Well, we'd have lots of content, which would be different for each web
site, possibly with some common parts. The content could definitely be
based on standard templates - it's unlikely we'd make each of a thousand
sites entirely from scratch.
</p><p>If we used JavaScript menus, we'd presumably use the same code in each
site, changing only the menu content to match the structure of the site.
</p><p>Most likely we'd use a unique CSS stylesheet for each site, to give each
site a unique look and feel, but they could also be based on a standard
template.
</p><p>Finally, the images and icons would be a mixture of standard graphics
and customised graphics, depending on how pretty we want each site to
look.
</p><p>Our model is going to be the basis for code generation, that is, the
mass production of as much of the above as is reasonable. To do this, we
need to make a compact and efficient statement of exactly what is needed
to produce each web site.
</p><p>It's like constructing a thousand houses. It's expensive to design and
build each house as a unique thing. It's much cheaper to make a single
common plan, and then for each house, state the differences. So one
house might have a different roof shape, while another has larger
windows, but all houses share the same materials, wall and floor
construction, and so on.
</p><p>When we mass produce something, we're clearly aiming for low cost and
consistent , and hopefully high, quality. It's the same with code
generation. So, let's get to our web site model. What information do we
actually need to specify?
</p><ul><li>
First, we need to know all the pages in the web site, so that we can build menus.</li><li>
Second, we need basic information for each page. Typically, I like to define a title and subtitle, an image (for pretty marketing purposes), and a block of content (which can be raw HTML).</li><li>
Third, we some information for all pages - for example, a logo and a copyright statement.</li></ul><p>The next step is to sketch a model that can hold this information in a
useful way. Remember that we use XML as a modeling language. So, we
invent an XML syntax for our model. For each page, I'd like to write
something like this:
</p><pre>
&lt;page
    name = &quot;name of page&quot;
    title = &quot;Title text goes here&quot;
    subtitle = &quot;Subtitle text goes here&quot;
    &gt;
&lt;content&gt;
Content HTML goes here
&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
</pre><p>When I design new XML languages like the above, I use entity attributes
to hold single-line properties, and child entities to hold multi-line
properties or properties that can occur more than once. It just seems
more elegant than putting properties in child entities, since this
implies those properties can occur many times. It does not make sense
for a page to have more than one name, title, subtitle, or image in our
model, so we define these as attributes of the page entity. The iMatix
MOP tools use this style very heavily.
</p><p>Once we've defined a set of pages, how do we tie these together into a
web site? Let's use a second model for the overall web site:
</p><pre>
&lt;site copyright = &quot;copyright statement goes here&quot;&gt;
&lt;section name = &quot;name of section&quot;&gt;
    &lt;page name = &quot;name of page&quot; /&gt; ...
&lt;/section&gt;...
&lt;/site&gt;
</pre><p>I've defined a &lt;section&gt; tag that breaks the pages into groups. Now
let's jump right in and make ourselves a web site. There's no better way
to test a model than to try using it. As an example, I'll make a new web
site for my local grocer, who has decided, finally, to go on-line.
</p><h1><a name="A3">3. First Draft of The Web Site Generator</a></h1><p>We'll make the web site as several XML files. This is a design choice.
We could also make the site as a single large XML file. It's a trade-off
between ease of use (a single file is easier in smaller cases) and
scalability (it's not practical to edit a large site with hundreds of
pages as a single file).
</p><p>To start with, we'll define the overall site like this:
</p><pre>
&lt;?xml version = &quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;site
    copyright = &quot;Copyright &amp;#169; Local Grocer&quot;
    script = &quot;sitegen_1.gsl&quot;
    &gt;
&lt;section name = &quot;Welcome&quot;&gt;
    &lt;page name = &quot;index&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section name = &quot;Products&quot;&gt;
    &lt;page name = &quot;fruit&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;page name = &quot;vegetables&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/site&gt;
</pre><p>Note the first line, which defines the file as XML, and the 'script'
tag, which tells GSL what script to run to process the data. We've
defined three pages. Let's write very a simple version of each of these:
</p><p>Next, we will write three more short XML files as shown below. First
the index page:
</p><pre>
&lt;page
    name = &quot;index&quot;
    title = &quot;Local Grocer&quot;
    subtitle = &quot;Visit the Local Grocer&quot;
    &gt;
&lt;content&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Close to you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're just around the corner, if you live near by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Always open&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we're closed, just come back tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cheap and convenient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much cheaper and easier than growing your own vegetables and fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
</pre><p>Next, the fruit page:
</p><pre>
&lt;page
    name = &quot;fruit&quot;
    title = &quot;Our Fruit Stand&quot;
    subtitle = &quot;Lucious Tropical Fruits&quot;
    &gt;
&lt;content&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Always fresh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like it was plucked from the tree last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Special deal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any five pieces of fruit, for the price of ten!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Money back if not satisfied&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll give you your money back if we're not satisfied with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
</pre><p>and last the vegetable page:
</p><pre>
&lt;page
    name = &quot;vegetables&quot;
    title = &quot;Our Vegetables&quot;
    subtitle = &quot;Healthy Organic Vegetables&quot;
&gt;
&lt;content&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;100% organic vegetables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All vegetables made from cardon, oxygen, and hydrogen molecules
with trace elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Country fresh style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't know what that means, but it sounded nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unique take-away concept&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can consume your vegetables in the comfort of your own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
</pre><p>Finally, here is the first draft of the web generation script. It does
not produce anything, it simply loads the web site data into an XML tree
and then saves this (in a file called root.xml) that we can look at to
see what live data the script is actually working with:
</p><pre>
.#  Since we run the script off the XML file, it starts in
.#  template mode.
.template 0
 for section
    for page
        #  Load XML &lt;page&gt; data
        xml to section from &quot;$(page.name).xml&quot;
        #  Delete old &lt;page&gt; tag
        delete page
    endfor
 endfor
 save root
.endtemplate
</pre><p>Let's look at what this script does. First, it switches off template
mode so we can write ordinary GSL without starting each line with a dot.
GSL starts scripts in template mode if they are launched from the XML
file. It's useful in many cases but not here. So, we wrap the whole
script in '.template 0' and '.endtemplate'.
</p><p>Second, the script works through each section and page, and loads the
XML data for that page. It does this using two commands, 'xml' and
'delete'. The first loads XML data from a file into the specified scope
(&lt;section&gt;, in this case), and the second deletes the current page
(since the loaded data also contains a &lt;page&gt; tag).
</p><p>Finally, the script saves the whole XML tree to a file. If you want to
try the next steps you must have installed GSL, as I described in the
last article. Run the script like this:
</p><pre>
gsl site
</pre><p>GSL looks for the file called 'site.xml'. When the script has run, take
a look at root.xml. This shows you what we're going to work with to
generate the real HTML.
</p><h1><a name="A4">4. Inserting Variables into Output</a></h1><p>When we generate output, we insert variable values into the generated
text. This is very much like using shell variables.
</p><p>GSL does automatic case conversion on output variable. This is very
useful when we generate programming languages. For example, the $(name)
form outputs a variable in lower case:
</p><pre>
output &quot;$(filename).c&quot;
</pre><p>The $(NAME) form outputs the same value in uppercase:
</p><pre>
#if defined ($(FILENAME)_INCLUDED)
</pre><p>And the $(Name) form outputs the variable in 'title' case, i.e. the
first letter is capitalised:
</p><pre>
#################  $(Filename)   #################
</pre><p>One side-effect of automatic case conversion is that we'll often get
variables converted to lower case simply because we used the $(name)
form. If we don't want a variable to be automatically case converted, we
use this form: $(name:). This is also called the 'empty modifier'.
</p><p>A second side-effect of automatic case conversion is that variable names
are not case sensitive. By default GSL ignores the case of variable
names so that $(me) and $(ME) refer to the same variable.
</p><p>But putting empty modifiers in every variable expansion gets tiresome,
and GSL lets us switch off automatic case conversion, using this
instruction:
</p><pre>
ignorecase = 0
</pre><p>This tells GSL, &quot;variable names are case-sensitive, and do not convert
variable values on output&quot;.
</p><h1><a name="A5">5. Iterating Through the XML Tree</a></h1><p>In our first draft we loaded each page into the XML tree and deleted the
original page definition. That was this text:
</p><pre>
for section
    for page
        xml to section from &quot;$(page.name).xml&quot;
        delete page
    endfor
endfor
</pre><p>To generate output for each page, we're going to iterate through the
sections one more time. Since we're deleting old &lt;page&gt; entities and
loading new ones from the XML definitions, we need to iterate through
the sections and pages over again. This is the code that generates the
output for each page:
</p><pre>
for section
    for page
        include &quot;template.gsl&quot;
    endfor
endfor
</pre><p>The include command executes GSL code in another file. We're going to do
all the hard work in a separate file, which I've called template.gsl, so
that it's easy to change the HTML generation independently from the
top-level GSL code. This is good practice for several reasons:
</p><p>It's nice, in larger projects, that each big code generation task sits
in its own file where it can be owned by a single person.
</p><p>We can add more templates - to produce other types of output - for the
same model very easily and safely.
</p><p>And you'll see in later examples that we tend to write a single GSL file
for each output we want to produce. In XNF - the tool we use for
larger-scale code generation projects - these scripts are called
&quot;targets&quot;.
</p><h1><a name="A6">6. Building the Web Pages</a></h1><p>The HTML template looks like this:
</p><pre>
.template 1
.echo &quot;Generating $(page.name) page...&quot;
.output &quot;$(page.name).html&quot;
&lt;!DOCTYPE...&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   ...
&lt;/html&gt;
.endtemplate
</pre><p>Most of it is fairly straight-forward, though you do need to understand
how XHTML and CSS work (and I'm not going to explain that here).
</p><ul><li>
The echo command tells the user what's going on. It's polite to do this, although in realistic cases we'll also let the user suppress such reports using a 'quiet' option.</li><li>
The output command creates the HTML page.</li><li>
The text &lt;!DOCTYPE...&gt; to &lt;/html&gt; is the body of the page, which I'll explain below.</li></ul><p>The template starts by setting template mode on. This means that any GSL
commands we want to use here must start with a dot. It makes the HTML
very easy to read and to maintain.
</p><p>Let's look at the chunk of code that produces the site index. This is -
in our version of the web site generator - a menu that is embedded into
each page. The CSS stylesheet can place this menu anywhere on the page.
Here is the GSL code that generates it:
</p><pre>
.for site.section
&lt;h3 class=&quot;menu_heading&quot;&gt;$(section.name)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;menu_item&quot;&gt;
.   for page
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;menu_item&quot;
    href=&quot;$(page.name).html&quot;&gt;$(page.title)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
.   endfor
&lt;/ul&gt;
.endfor
</pre><p>The interesting thing here is that we say for site.section in order to
iterate through the sections. The site. prefix is a parent scope name,
it tells GSL &quot;look for all sections in the current site&quot;. If we don't
use the scope name, GSL would look for all sections in the current scope
(the page) and find nothing. This is a common beginner's error.
</p><p>Note that the parent scope is not always needed. These two blocks do
exactly the same thing:
</p><pre>
.for site.section
.   for page
.   endfor
.endfor
</pre><p>and:
</p><pre>
.for site.section
.   for section.page
.   endfor
.endfor
</pre><p>But the first form is simpler and I recommend you drop explicit parent
scope names when you are &quot;tunneling into&quot; the XML data tree.
</p><p>Near the end of the template you see this construction:
</p><pre>
.for content
$(content.string ())
.endfor
</pre><p>What is going on here? The answer is, we're grabbing the whole &lt;content&gt;
block, including all the XML it contains, as a single string.
Conveniently, XHTML is also XML, so we can read the XHTML content block
as part of our XML data file. As a bonus, GSL will also validate it and
tell you if there are errors, such as missing or malformed tags.
</p><p>The scope string() function returns a string that holds the XML value of
the specified entity. For the index page, it returns this value (as a
single string):
</p><p>&lt;content&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Close to you&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're just around the corner, if you live
near by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Always open&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if we're closed, just come back
tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cheap and convenient&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much cheaper and easier
than growing your own vegetables and fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/content&gt;
</p><p>When we enclose this in $( and ), it writes the string to the current
output file. Thus we generate the body of the web page.
</p><h1><a name="A7">7. Putting it All Together</a></h1><p>In our first draft we read the XML data from several files and we
constructed a single tree with all the data we needed to generate code.
This two-pass approach is the way I recommend you construct all GSL code
generators:
</p><ul><li>
First, load all data into a single memory tree, denormalise and validate.</li><li>
Second, generate code from that single memory tree.</li></ul><p>The final web site generator consists of three pieces, shown in listings
6, 7, and 8:
</p><p>Here is the revised web site generator.
</p><pre>
.# Since we run the script off the XML file, it starts in
.# template mode.
.template 0
 ignorecase = 0
 for section
    for page
        xml to section from &quot;$(page.name).xml&quot;
        delete page
    endfor
 endfor
 for section
    for page
        include &quot;template.gsl&quot;
    endfor
 endfor

</pre><p>To build the final web site, make sure the site.xml specifies the
correct script:
</p><pre>
&lt;site
    copyright = &quot;Copyright &amp;#169; Local Grocer&quot;
    script = &quot;<b>sitegen.gsl</b>&quot;
    &gt;
</pre><p>And then build the web site using the same command as previously:
</p><pre>
gsl site
</pre><p>The HTML template and the CSS file are made for each other. Note that:
</p><ul><li>
The HTML template assumes that each page has an image file with the name of the page, and extension &quot;jpg&quot;.</li><li>
The colors and layout of the pages is defined in the CSS stylesheet.</li><li>
The menu is generated into each page.</li></ul><h1><a name="A8">8. Exercise for the Reader</a></h1><p>It's an interesting exercise to re-implement our code generator using
other code generation tools. For example, if you're familiar with XSLT,
try building the web site generator using that. You may find you need to
cheat, for example putting the whole web site model into a single file.
</p><h1><a name="A9">9. Extending the Model</a></h1><p>I've shown you how to design a simple model, and bring it to life using
GSL. This web site generator is actually based on one that I use for
some of my own web sites. You can extend this model in many directions,
for instance:
</p><ul><li>
You can change the type of menu, using a JavaScript drop-down menu instead of static HTML links.</li><li>
You can define your own modeling language for the HTML content.</li><li>
You can add other concepts and idioms to the model, depending on what you need in your web site.</li></ul><p>But most of all, the point of this example is to teach you how to use
GSL in your daily work. As you've seen, it's easy to create models, and
it's easy to change them. This is the secret of code generation - you
don't need to get it right the first time. Models are hard to get right.
So go ahead and experiment, since GSL makes it cheap to change your
mind.
</p><h1><a name="A10">10. Conclusion</a></h1><p>In this article we defined a simple model for a web site, and we built a
code generation toolset for that model. In our very simple case, the
toolset consists of about 100 lines of GSL. Using that, we can turn
fifty lines of modeling language into about three times that amount of
perfect HTML.
</p><p>In the next article in this series we'll design a much more
sophisticated model using the XNF (XML Normal Form) modeling tool, which
is a MOP tool that we use to build MOP tools. I'll go into more detail
on different aspects of GSL's syntax and show you how to turn MOP theory
into real practice on a medium-scale problem.
